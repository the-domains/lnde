## Families from all over Europe are
working together to defeat Lesch-Nyhan Disease

Lesch-Nyhan Disease (LND) is a rare
condition that affects children at a very young age. Children with
this disease get kidney stones, they cannot control their muscles,
and they develop an irresistible urge to try to hurt themselves
(self-injurious behaviour).

There is curently no cure for this
disease.

In many countries, families have
formed networks, support groups and associations in order to help
each other, to create awareness about the disease and to promote
and support scientific research.

In 2014, these groups are joining
forces by setting up a European Federation.
